# Leveraging Deep Learning For Malarial Parasite Detection Using Blood Smear Images

## Overview
MalariaNet is a deep learning project aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of malaria parasite detection using thin blood smear images. The project employs state-of-the-art deep learning models and techniques to automate and enhance the diagnostic process for malaria.

## Goals
- Develop and compare different deep learning models for malaria parasite detection.
- Increase accuracy and efficiency in malaria diagnosis through automated image analysis.
- Contribute to the fight against malaria by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision.

## Features
- Dataset: A comprehensive dataset of thin blood smear images, curated and annotated for training and testing purposes.
- Models: Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with different layers, VGG16, and ResNet to compare their performance in detecting malarial parasites.
- Training and Evaluation: Rigorous experiments conducted, involving training the models on the dataset and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, loss.
- Implications and Future Research: Discussion on the potential real-world applications of the developed models and recommendations for future research in the field of malaria detection.
